title: Rice Pilaf

This Bon Apetit [[article|https://www.bonappetit.com/test-kitchen/how-to/article/rice-pilaf]] describes the principle. The ratio should be:
* 1/2 onion, 2 cloves garlic
* 1 cup rice
* 1 1/2 cup water
And the rice should be toasted for 4 min and then steamed for 12 min.

I made a good version with 1/2 T garam masala, a chopped tomato, and a handful of chopped pistachios. Don't forge the salt!
