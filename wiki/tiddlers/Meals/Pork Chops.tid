title: Pork Chops

For Trader Joes' boneless chops, 7 minutes on medium turning every minute was about right. Finish with a tablespoon of butter and a few smashed garlic cloves. Dry aging did improve the crust a little bit. Be careful not to overcook a second round of chops when the pan is hotter.

Giant chops are very thick (1.5 in) so I heated the pan on high, added olive oil, turned the pan down to medium, and seared all sides. Then I baked at 400 until they reached 140. This was a bit overdone, so try 130.
